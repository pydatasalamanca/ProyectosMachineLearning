### Elections again? Are politicians equally treated according to their gender?

The detection of hate speech has become a priority given the huge amount of information that is spread every day on the Web. These communications are commonly targeted to a group of individuals with a specific ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or religion.

This project aims to detect hateful comments addressed to the main female political leaders in Spain by developing automatic tools based on machine learning and natural language processing.
